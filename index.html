            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Jonas, I live in Amstelveen in the Netherlands and I am currently studying game development at MediaCollege Amsterdam. 
                I specialize in developing games in the unity engine but I am also trying to learn other software and programming languages. 
                I hope to learn more about the unity engine and programming as a whole in the jobs I will work at.</p>
            <p>Just like many others I was interested in videogames from a young age, I was always looking for new games to express my endless creativity in. 
                Thatâ€™s why some of my favourite games are those that encourage you to be creative such as games like; Minecraft, Scrap Mechanic and Terraria. 
                But i do also love a good first person shooter.</p>
            <p>I always do my best to handle everyone with the respect they deserve and to be as positive as possible, 
                I can work efficiently in both a solo and a team environment and I always care about making the end product the best it can be. Currently 
                I am still a student but I hope to soon be part of many great projects and learn a lot from the industry.</p>

                <h3>Introduction to the project</h3>
                <p>This was a group vertical slice project we were developing for school, we had ~3 months to make a vertical slice of the first part of the first level in the game we chose: Ultrakill. The group consisted of 4 developers and 3 game artists and with us being in control of who does what part.</p>
                <h3>My contribution</h3>
                <p>The parts I contributed to the project were; Making the entire movement, making a dash ability, making the shooting system, making the UI functional, and making the start sequence of the level. We managed to successfully finish our project within the deadline, although it was pretty close since this was quite a complex project.</p>

                        <h2>What is Ultrakill even about?</h2>
                        <p>Ultrakill is a very fast-paced movement shooter in which you traverse your way through various linear levels. I personally really like the game and I've played it a bit before starting this project and since I was tasked with creating the movement and shooting functionality i really wanted to capture that fast-paced action that Ultrakill manages to do so well.</p>

                <p>In the visual sheet displayed here i explain how the dash ability works as this was probably the hardest part of the entire movement functionality,
                below you can see the dash sequence part of the script:</p>

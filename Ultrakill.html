                <h3>Introduction to the project</h3>
                <p>This was a group vertical slice project we were developing for school, we had ~3 months to make a vertical slice of the first part of the first level in the game we chose: Ultrakill. The group consisted of 4 developers and 3 game artists and with us being in control of who does what part.</p>
                <h3>My contribution</h3>
                <p>The parts I contributed to the project were; Making the base movement, making a dash ability, making the shooting system, making the UI functional, and making the start sequence of the level. We managed to successfully finish our project within the deadline, although it was pretty close since this was quite a complex project.</p>
